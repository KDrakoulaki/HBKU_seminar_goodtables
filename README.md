# HBKU_seminar_goodtables

This is the repository for the goodtables seminar presented at HBKU MA in Digital Humanities. It contains the mock .csv file, the original xlsx file, and a csv version with only 999 rows for use on the goodtables.io tool. Both csv versions have errors in either row duplication, or missing headers.
